I used Java for all 3 problems in this Lab assignment.
I chose Java simply because that's the language I've used the most during my time at Brooklyn College
The difficulty I had was for part 3. I don't have any experience at all doing things like that and had to look around online for how to do the assignment.
At this point, I wouldn't use another language to these assignments
